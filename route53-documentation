route53--> is it global service

how www.xyz.com works:
---------------------------------
user enter an url(www.xyz.com in the web browser)
the internet service provider appends(.) which is root name server to the url
---->www.xyz.com.
and then root name server tells about where to search in this case it will tell to search
in .com(TLD)(Top Level Domain) name server
and then it will search in that .com name server, we will be having record set(DomainName+ip) in .com name server

*DNS works with UDP protocol

www.xyz.com --(appends . i.e root name server)---> www.xyz.com. 
-->root name server tell's to serach in which TLD--> .com TLD --->it will 
search in that .com TLD(Top Level Domain) has record sets(DomainName+ip)

route53 polices:-
----------------
we can choose the routing polices
1.simple routing policy
2.geo-location  -- we can map user to application based on the nearest geo-location
routing the traffic to the nearest location
3.fail over -- if one thing fails it will map to the working one
4.ip based
5.weighted
6.latency


to check the nameserver of your domain in windows
----------------------------------------------------
open windows powershell
CMD: Resolve-DnsName tharunpro.in -type NS

**NLB ip address will not change ALB ip address will change

we will create domain in godaddy
domain name: tharunpro.in
created aws hosted zone
will change the name server of the domina in godaddy to the aws hosted zone name servers

we can create a record in hosted zone and can map the 
cnmae, aname 
ex:
meetp.tharunpro.in this will map to the some lb endpoint
so whenever you access meetp.tharunpro.in you will get the application
name to name mapping
ip address to name mapping

ACM(Amazon certified manager):
----------------------------------
request a certificate 
and choose certificate type (public/private)
and flle the fully qulaified domain name
always give *.domainName it is called SNI/AWS SAN certs
-----------------------------------------------------------
in one certificate if we have multiple names 
becuase we can add somany website to the domain name, we cannot always come and request a certificate
for the web-site
